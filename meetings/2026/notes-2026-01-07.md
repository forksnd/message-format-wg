## Updates from Implementers

TIM: Still waiting for an ICU4C review

## Spec for LDML v49

*The changes since LDML 48 are seen in [this diff](https://github.com/unicode-org/message-format-wg/compare/d78eb6f..ceeb995), and they consist of:*

* [*Finalize :percent \#1100*](https://github.com/unicode-org/message-format-wg/pull/1100)  
* [*Finalize :currency \#1101*](https://github.com/unicode-org/message-format-wg/pull/1101)  
* [*Drop u:locale \#1102*](https://github.com/unicode-org/message-format-wg/pull/1102)

MIH & EAO: Long discussion on the process used to approve and land the PRs, and in general making decisions.

Conclusion: The current spec is approved for recommendation to the CLDR-TC.

## Unit Formatting

EAO: anyone interested in contributing a spec on unit formatting

TIM: no bandwidth for this

MIH: I can only say a bit later, right now it is a lot of planning for the new year.

## Default Attribute Definitions

EAO: I've refactored [PR #1098](https://github.com/unicode-org/message-format-wg/pull/1098) so that it's hopefully easier to read, and (as discussed at the last call) included this note at the top:

> **Important**
>
> This part of the specification is under incubation by the MessageFormat WG, and may end up being finalized elsewhere. It is non-normative.

EAO: I've also dropped the message-level `@max-length`, `@source`, and `@version` attributes, and applied other suggestions from above.

Conclusion: If/once MIH reviews and approves, this can be merged.
